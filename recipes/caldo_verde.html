        </li>
        <li>
            6 cups (1.4L) homemade or store-bought low-sodium chicken stock
        </li>
        <li>
            1 bunch curly or lacinato kale, tough stems removed, leaves finely chopped (about 3/4 pound; 340g)
        </li>
        <li>
            12 ounces (340g) cooked lingui√ßa or other garlicky pork sausage, cut into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices
        </li>
        <li>
            Minced fresh chives, for garnish (optional)

    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Heat butter in a large Dutch oven or saucepan over medium heat until melted.
            Add onion (or leek) and garlic, season with salt and pepper, and cook, 
            stirring frequently, until softened but not browned, about 5 minutes, 
            adding olive oil as necessary to keep the mixture loose and moist. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Add potatoes and stock and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally.
            Add kale and continue to cook until russet potato slices have completely 
            broken down (you can press them with a spoon or potato masher for an even 
            thicker texture), the Yukon Golds are tender, the greens have softened, 
            and the soup has thickened to a creamy consistency, 25 to 30 minutes.
            Stir in sausage. Season soup to taste with salt and pepper and serve 
            garnished with chives, if desired.
