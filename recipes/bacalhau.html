    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>454 g dried salt cod, soaked overnight and cooked</li>
        <li>105 ml olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>680 g russet potatoes, peeled, cut into matchstick-size strips (about 6 cups)</li>
        <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>8 large eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons chopped flat-leaf parsley leaves, divided</li>
        <li>18 black or green olives</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Instructions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Flake the fish, discarding any bones.
        </li>
        <li>
            Heat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a heavy, large nonstick skillet 
            over medium-high heat. Add the potatoes in batches and saute until 
            crisp and golden, about 7 minutes per batch. Transfer the potatoes 
            to paper towels to drain.
        </li>
        <li>
            Add 1 tablespoon of the oil to the same skillet. Add the onion and 
            bay leaf and saute until golden, about 15 minutes. Discard the bay 
            leaf. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Reduce the heat to low. Add the remaining 2 tablespoons oil to 
            the onion slices in the skillet. Mix in the fish and potatoes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk the eggs, the 1/2 teaspoon salt, and the 1/2 teaspoon pepper 
            in a large bowl to blend. Add the egg mixture and 3 tablespoons of 
            the parsley to the fish mixture in the skillet. Cook over medium 
            heat until the eggs are softly set, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. 
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the eggs to a platter. Garnish with the olives and the remaining 
            1 tablespoon parsley.
        </li>
    </ol>
