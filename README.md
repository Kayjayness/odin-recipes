Hey there, I just finished up my first project at The Odin Project. This project, called "Recipes" in the foundation course, had us create a fully functional HTML website that included a homepage and three separate recipe pages.

During this project, I was able to showcase a few skills, like:

    Getting the hang of the basic HTML setup and being able to write it from scratch.
    Understanding how to structure a basic HTML page.
    Figuring out how to link things in HTML, work with lists, and add images.
    Performing basic command line.. commands. For example creating, moving, copying, and deleting files.
    Tackling the basics of Git and GitHub, such as setting up repositories, making commits, and keeping a log of what I did.

I've got to admit, it's pretty cool working with files through the command line. Plus, I've been playing around with Visual Studio Code settings. Plotting down huge block of text doesn't exactly make the code look clean.

Although the project itself didn't give me too much trouble, I did run into a bit of what I see folks call "scope creep." I got so excited that I wanted to create like ten recipe pages! But then I realized that might be a bit much for this assignment, so I dialed it back and stuck with the three required pages... plus one.

Let's see what comes next!
